CACHE CLEARING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SMO SOCIAL DEBUGGING
====================================================

The 403 errors were caused by browser caching the old JavaScript file.
I've updated the version to force reload. Here's how to clear cache:

1. HARD REFRESH (Recommended)
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - This forces browser to reload all files from server

2. BROWSER CACHE CLEARING
   - Chrome: F12 → Right-click reload button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   - Safari: Develop menu → Empty Caches

3. CHECK VERSION IN CONSOLE
   After clearing cache, the JavaScript should show version "1.0.1-debug"
   instead of "1.0.0" in the script URL.

4. VERIFY DEBUGGING OUTPUT
   After cache clear, you should see:
   - "SMO Chat Debug: Initialization config:" in console
   - "SMO Chat Debug: Making API request to:" for each API call
   - Server-side "SMO Debug:" messages in PHP error logs

This will load the updated debugging code and show us exactly what's causing the 403 errors.
